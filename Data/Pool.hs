-- | Take a resource from the pool, perform an action with it and return it to
-- the pool afterwards.
--
-- * If the pool has an idle resource available, it is used immediately.
--
-- * Otherwise, if the maximum number of resources has not yet been reached, a
--   new resource is created and used.
--
-- * If the maximum number of resources has been reached, this function blocks
--   until a resource becomes available.
--
-- If the action throws an exception of any type, the resource is destroyed and
-- not returned to the pool.
--
-- It probably goes without saying that you should never manually destroy a
-- pooled resource, as doing so will almost certainly cause a subsequent user
-- (who expects the resource to be valid) to throw an exception.
